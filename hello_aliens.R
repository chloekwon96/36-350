cat("Hi aliens, my name is Chloe Kwon. To be honest, I donâ€™t really believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life right now. In my final project for 36-350, Statistical Computing, we saw that there was no star system with both habitable and earthlike planets. There was one however, TRAPPIST-1, with some of each but as far as my limited scientific knowledge holds, I highly doubt that you guys exist. Please be discovered by our scientists soon and turn over my doubt. I wonder if that will happen within my lifetime. Until then, stay safe! Bye!")
